# VBA_Challenge
The purpose of this analysis was to be analyze the entire stock dataset. Using the previous information for the basket of stocks, I was able to refactor the code to handle a higher number of data. Using this I'll be able to quickly give stock performance on a large number of stocks.

## Results of the Analysis

- Almost all the stocks performed incredibly well in 2017 with only TEPR having a negative performance and many of the stocks having returns of over 100%. Unless they were in a sector that had a negative correlation to the whole stock market, it could very well be inferred that the stock market as a whole performed very well.

- 2018 was a very different year when comparing to 2017. The only stocks to perform well were ENPH and RUN who did over 80% while all the other stocks struggled and had varying negative performances. It would be very interesting to see how the market performed as a whole to see if the stock market struggled as a whole or if it was just attached to an area of the market that included these stocks.

- After refactoring the code, I was able to return the entire stock analysis in a time of 0.11 seconds for either 2017 or 2018.

### Summary of Analysis
- Refactoring can be a great tool to help a person understand and maintain code. It can help someone understand the code better or help the design. The disadvantages that come with refactoring is you can have opportunities to create new problems as you change things. This could lead you to spend more time fixing a problem you've created and can eat into your budget or time set aside and if you're working on a deadline that could be a huge issue. Specifically in this module, I had to come back to this code months later, just because I was running into issues from refactoring and I had to prioritize other parts of my class.
